A Restful Approach...

- Endpoint for a particular book:

  domain.com/books/:id

- Endpoint for getting the author info of that book:

  domain.com/authors/:id

A GraphQL Approach...

- Query to get book data and its author data (AND the other books)

{
  book(id: 123) {
    title
    genre
    reviews
    author {
      name
      bio
      books {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

- if we want less information, we can query...
  (we only want the titles of the book(s) and name of author)

{
  book(id: 123) {
    title
    author{
      name
    }
    books {
      name
    }
  }
}
